# Terraform Landing Zone for MongoDB Atlas on Azure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Terraform Landing Zone for MongoDB Atlas on Azure assumes that you already successfully implemented an Azure landing zone. However, you can use the Terraform Landing Zone for MongoDB Atlas on Azure if your infrastructure doesn't conform to Azure landing zones. For more information, refer to [Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/)
>
> We recommend evaluating whether additional Microsoft security services beyond those listed, e.g Azure Firewall, Defender for DDoS, Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Entra, and Azure Key Vault - are appropriate for your environment. Depending on your architecture and threat model, you may also want to consider among other options:

## Overview

This repository provides a modular Terraform solution for deploying a secure MongoDB Atlas environment on Azure, featuring:

- Private networking and secure connectivity
- DevOps automation for remote state and identity
- End-to-end cluster setup for MongoDB Atlas
- Observability and monitoring infrastructure, including Azure Application Insights and a Metrics Function App for centralized metrics collection
- Automation for provisioning infrastructure, configuring Atlas clusters, and deploying a test application for connectivity validation

It supports both **single-region** and **multi-region** deployments.

The infrastructure can be deployed using the provided GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automation (see the [Pipeline Deployment Guide](docs/wiki/Deploy-with-pipeline.md)) or manually with Terraform (see the [Manual Deployment Steps](docs/wiki/Deploy-with-manual-steps.md)). The recommended method is deployment via workflows to ensure full automation, while manual deployment through the CLI remains available as an alternative.

> For step-by-step deployment guidance, see the [deployment guide](docs/wiki/Introduction.md).
