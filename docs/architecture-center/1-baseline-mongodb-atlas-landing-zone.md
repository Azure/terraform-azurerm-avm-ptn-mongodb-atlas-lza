# Baseline MongoDB Atlas Reference Architecture in an Azure Landing Zone

## Overview

This document describes a MongoDB Atlas reference architecture designed for deployment in an Azure landing zone environment. The architecture provides secure, private connectivity between Azure resources and MongoDB Atlas clusters while following Azure landing zone principles for resource organization and governance.

The solution demonstrates how to deploy MongoDB Atlas in an enterprise Azure environment with proper network segmentation, private connectivity, and infrastructure automation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What are Azure landing zones?**
>
> Azure landing zones divide your organization's cloud footprint into two key areas:
>
> - An application landing zone is an Azure subscription where a workload runs. An application landing zone connects to your organization's shared platform resources. That connection provides the landing zone with access to the infrastructure that supports the workload, such as networking, identity access management, policies, and monitoring.
>
> - A platform landing zone is a collection of various subscriptions that multiple platform teams can manage. Each subscription has a specific function. For example, a connectivity subscription provides centralized Domain Name System (DNS) resolution, cross-premises connectivity, and network virtual appliances (NVAs) for platform teams.

## Architecture

This landing zone accelerator supports two deployment patterns based on your requirements:

### Single-Region Architecture

The single-region deployment provides a straightforward MongoDB Atlas setup within a single Azure region, ideal for applications with regional data residency requirements or simpler connectivity needs.

> **Architecture Basis:**
> This deployment follows the [Single-Region Deployment Paradigm](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/architecture/current/deployment-paradigms/single-region/) from MongoDB Atlas. All cluster nodes are placed within a single region, leveraging cloud provider availability zones for added resilience. This is the most cost-effective option and is suitable when the risk of a regional failure is acceptable.

### Multi-Region Architecture

The multi-region deployment provides enhanced availability and disaster recovery capabilities with MongoDB Atlas clusters distributed across multiple Azure regions, connected via VNet peering.

> **Architecture Basis:**
> This deployment is based on the [5-Node, 3-Region Architecture (2+2+1)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/architecture/current/deployment-paradigms/multi-region/#5-node--3-region-architecture--2-2-1-) recommended by MongoDB Atlas. It ensures near-instant recovery in case of a regional outage, with nodes distributed across three regions (2+2+1) for automated failover and data loss protection during maintenance or full regional incidents.

## Networking

### Network Design Overview

The MongoDB Atlas Azure Landing Zone supports both single-region and multi-region network topologies, each optimized for different availability and performance requirements.

#### Single-Region Network Topology

**Design Pattern**: All resources deployed within a single Azure region for simplicity and optimal performance.

**Key Components**:

- **Virtual Network**: Single VNet with dedicated address space
- **Private Subnet**: Hosts private endpoint for MongoDB Atlas connectivity  
- **NAT Gateway**: Provides secure outbound internet access
- **Private Endpoint**: Azure Private Link connection to MongoDB Atlas
- **Network Security Groups**: Control traffic flow with least-privilege rules

**Benefits**:

- Simplified management and configuration
- Lowest latency for regional applications
- Cost-effective for single-region deployments

**Limitations**:

## Metrics & Observability

### Architecture Overview

The solution provisions Azure-native observability resources for monitoring, logging, and metrics collection for MongoDB Atlas and supporting infrastructure.

#### Key Components

- **Application Insights**: Receives metrics from the Function App and provides dashboards, analytics, and alerting.
- **Function App**: Runs on a schedule, queries the MongoDB Atlas API for metrics, and pushes results to Application Insights.
- **Service Plan**: Hosts the Function App.
- **Storage Account & Container**: Stores the Function App code package and logs securely.
- **Private DNS Zones**: Provide private DNS resolution for Azure monitoring and storage endpoints.
- **Private Endpoints**: Secure connectivity for Application Insights, Storage Account, and monitoring resources.
- **Subnets for Observability**: Created in the VNet of the target region. Used for Function App and Private Endpoint placement.

#### Metrics Collection Flow

1. **Function App Execution**: The Function App runs on a schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes) using a timer trigger.
2. **Atlas API Query**: The function authenticates to the MongoDB Atlas API and retrieves cluster metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, connections, disk usage).
3. **Metrics Push**: Retrieved metrics are sent to Application Insights for visualization, alerting, and long-term analysis.
4. **Secure Storage**: Function code and logs are stored in a dedicated Storage Account, accessible only via private endpoints.
5. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Application Insights provides dashboards, query capabilities, and alerting for operational health and performance.
